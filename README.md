# Data-Analysis-for-ISP
This analysis will be very helpful in selecting an ISP based on internet speed fluctuations.
## Objective:
This project analyzes network performance metrics—including internet speed, latency, packet loss, and signal strength—to identify patterns, optimize connectivity, and recommend improvements for better reliability and speed.

## Key Focus Areas:
1.	Speed & Latency: Compare download/upload speeds and ping times across different connection types (Fiber, DSL, Cable).
2.	Stability: Investigate packet loss and signal strength to pinpoint weak spots.
3.	ISP Performance: Rank ISPs by quality scores and their impact on speed.
4.	External Factors: Assess how weather and network congestion affect performance.
## Tools & Methods:
•	Data: CSV-structured network logs 
•	Analysis: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib) for statistical insights and visualizations.
•	Output: Actionable recommendations for users and ISPs.

## Expected Insights:
•	Fiber connections offer 2x faster speeds than DSL/Cable.
•	High packet loss (>1%) correlates with weak signal strength (≤75 dBm).
•	Top-rated ISPs (score ≥7.0) reduce latency by 30%.
